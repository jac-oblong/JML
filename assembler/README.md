# Assemblers

This directory contains the source code for all assemblers used in the making of
the computer(s).

Each subdirectory is the name of a chip number and/or computer name. Those with
a computer name are for the microprocessor and are meant for use on the finished
computer.

More information about the acceptable syntax, commands, etc for each chip can be
found in the README of each subdirectory.

Additionally, when applicable, the code & schematic used to program the chip 
will be given in the applicable subdirectory. Usually, an Arduino based
microcontroller is used to program the chips, but the exact method used will be
given.
