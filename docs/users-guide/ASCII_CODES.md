# JML ASCII CODES
The following tables show *ascii* codes used in the **jml** computers.

Since the base **jml** computers are 8-bit, and *ascii* only uses 7 of the bits,
the 8th bit is used as a control bit, allowing different control signals to be 
sent via this modified version of *ascii*. The full list of control signals can 
be found below.

## ASCII Codes
No *ascii* codes are altered, however, some are ignored. The ignored signals are
entirely control characters. The full list of ignored characters is below.
