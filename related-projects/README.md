# jml Related Projects
This directory contains additional projects that are related to the **jml** 
project. These additional projects may be specific programs written for the **jml**
computers, add-ons to the computers, or entirely separate projects that were
useful in the development of the **jml** computers.

These projects do not occur in any particular order.

## Arduino Z80 Debugger
This is a small Arduino-based project designed to capture output signals from 
a **Z80 CPU**. 

More details: [Arduino Z80 Debugger](arduino-debugger).

## Arduino RAM Tester
This is a small Arduino-based project designed to test whether or not a ram IC
is working. The tests are very basic and not at all comprehensive.

More details: [Arduino RAM Tester](ram-tester).

## Arduino ROM Reader
This is a small Arduino-based project designed to read the contents of a ROM IC
and print it to a Serial monitor.

More details: [Arduino ROM Reader](rom-reader).

## Text Editor
This is a very simplistic text editor designed to be run on a **jml** computer.
While it can, in theory, be run on a **jml-8**, it would not be useful, as there
is no memory. As such, it is really meant for the **jml-8+** computer.
