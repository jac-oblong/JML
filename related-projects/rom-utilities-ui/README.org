* ROM UTILITIES UI

This directory contains a C program to improve the user experience when using the
[[../rom-utilities][ROM Utilities]].

** USAGE

The program allows users to both read from the EEPROM and write to it, including
reading and writing from files.

The program will first prompt the user for the path to the connected Arduino.
Once connection with the Arduino has been confirmed, the user will be prompted
with a command.

There are four commands which can be given, all of which can be lower or upper
case:

 - RF: will prompt user for name of file and then read contents of EEPROM into
   that file
 - R: will print out contents of EEPROM
 - WF: will prompt user for name of file and then write contents of file to the
   EEPROM
 - W: will prompt user for starting address (in hexadecimal), will then prompt
   user for data (in hexadecimal) which will be written to EEPROM, then address
   will be incremented and user will be prompted for data again, entering a value
   that cannot be interpreted as hexadecimal will exit the command
