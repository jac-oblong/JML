* ROM UTILITIES UI

This directory contains a C program to improve the user experience when using the
[[../rom-utilities][ROM Utilities]].

** USAGE

The program allows users to both read from the EEPROM and write to it, including
reading and writing from files.

The program will first prompt the user for the path to the connected Arduino.
Once connection with the Arduino has been confirmed, the user will be prompted
with a command.

There are three commands which can be given, all of which can be lower or upper
case:

 - R: will prompt user for name of file and then read contents of EEPROM into
   that file
 - W: will prompt user for name of file and then write contents of file to the
   EEPROM, if the size of the file does not match the size of the EEPROM (8192)
   bytes, the remaining data will be programmed with 0x00
 - Q: quit the program
