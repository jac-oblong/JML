# JML-8 ARDUINO DEGUGGER
An Arduino Mega was somewhat useful in debugging the Z80 CPU. It was used a few 
times, but an Analog Discovery was used most of the time.

This debugger was used only a few times (<5) so does not have many features and
is not very reliable.

All the code used is present in this directory.
