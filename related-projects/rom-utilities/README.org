* ROM UTILITIES

These utilities are designed for AT28C64 and similar EEPROMs. It allows for
reading and programming the EEPROM.

An Arduino Mega is used to interface with the EEPROM, and schematics can be
found in the folder of the same name. KiCad was used for the schematics.

This [[program][]] allows for a friendlier interface to the Arduino. It has
only been tested on a Linux machine, so may not work on other operating systems.
