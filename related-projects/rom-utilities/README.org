* ROM UTILITIES

These utilities are designed for AT28C64 and similar EEPROMs. It allows for
reading and programming the EEPROM.

An Arduino Mega is used to interface with the EEPROM, and schematics can be
found in the folder of the same name. KiCad was used for the schematics.

NOTE: HIGH on the Arduino Mega is considered to be above 5V, however, the
AT28C64 EEPROM considers HIGH to be above 2.4V. This can cause problems
when reading from the EEPROM. While this program does allow for reading
from the EEPROM, it was primarily designed for writing, using a different
micro-controller (or using the analog inputs) can solve this problem.
