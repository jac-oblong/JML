* EXAMPLES
This directory contains some example programs that can be run on
the *JML-8-Mini*. Both the source code and a formatted text file
are provided. The text file makes loading the program easier,
as a serial monitor can use the file as input, instead of manually
typing in the program. Be sure to increase the time between sent
characters and the time between lines when doing this so that
the BASIC interpreter/memory monitor has enough time to process
the incoming data.
