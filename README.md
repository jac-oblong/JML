16-bit computer built from scrap

## Parts
All parts have been scrapped from other computers/electronics. Using different
parts will likely produce a better computer.

### Changing parts
The software for this computer is designed in such a way that parts can easily
be swapped out for a different component with similar functionality. For
example, changing the microprocessor will only require editing the assembler.

Obviously, the hardware design is much more reliant on the specific component
used, so changing parts will not be as easy.

## Design
The computer is designed in individual sections that come together to create the
whole system. This is useful as it makes changing a section easy.

## Organization
The individual sections each have their own folder with schematics, code, etc.
There is also a general schematic with a overview of the whole computer.

Compilers, assemblers, and software are all grouped together in their own
folder, are general for all sections.
